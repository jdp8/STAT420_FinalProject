# STAT 420 Final Project

A report of the final project of the STAT 420 course of the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The project consisted of using advanced
statistics to help predict a player's efficiency rating(PER). Various
linear regression models were built using different combinations of
predictors. Click [here](https://jdp8.github.io/projectPages/STAT420_FinalProject/Final_Project_STAT420.html)

## Data Source

This data contains advanced statistics from NBA players since the 3-point
line was introduced in 1980 and is available on 
[Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com), but only on a yearly basis. In order for us to
extract the whole data set we created a scraper that gathered the data 
of every year from 1980 to 2020. We then merged it into a single CSV 
file ready to be loaded into R-Studio.
